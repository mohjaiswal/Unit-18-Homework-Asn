## Description

PyChain Ledger is a blockchain-based ledger system with a user-friendly web interface built using Python and Streamlit. This system allows for secure recording and verification of financial transactions through a decentralized ledger implementation.

## Features

- Blockchain-based ledger system
- Web-based user interface using Streamlit
- Transaction recording with sender, receiver, and amount
- Proof of work consensus mechanism
- Block validation system
- Block inspection capabilities
- Adjustable mining difficulty

## Technical Architecture

The project consists of several key components:

- `Record` data class for transaction data
- `Block` data class for blockchain structure
- `PyChain` class for chain management
- Streamlit interface for user interaction

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pychain-ledger.git

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Required packages:
# - streamlit
# - pandas
# - hashlib
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd pychain-ledger
```

2. Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run pychain.py
```

3. Use the web interface to:
   - Enter transaction details (sender, receiver, amount)
   - Add blocks to the chain
   - Inspect blocks
   - Validate the blockchain
   - Adjust mining difficulty

## Technical Components

### Record Data Class
- Stores transaction information
- Attributes: sender, receiver, amount

### Block Data Class
- Contains transaction records
- Includes: timestamp, creator ID, previous hash, nonce
- Implements hash calculation

### PyChain Class
- Manages the blockchain
- Implements proof of work
- Handles chain validation

## Testing

To test the system:
1. Launch the Streamlit interface
2. Add multiple transactions
3. Verify block contents in the dropdown menu
4. Test blockchain validation
5. Adjust difficulty and observe mining impact
